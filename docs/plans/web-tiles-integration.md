# Web Tiles Integration — Design Plan

**Date:** 2026-10-09
**Status:** Planned. Not started. This is the current plan for Web Tiles in
Roomy. `docs/plans/web-tiles-roomy-feasibility.md` is the earlier feasibility
read, kept as a historical record; §0 below states which of its conclusions
still hold.
**Next:** Milestone A (§11.1) — render a standalone tile in app-lite through a
tile loading server. That needs a `TileMothership` and a loading domain, and can
be exercised against the loader's default domain before Roomy deploys its own
(§11.3).
**Scope of the funded stint:** two weeks, two features (§5, §6), plus a
30-day engagement write-up (§10).
**Verified against:** `origin/next` @ `4276631e`.
**Packages:** `packages/app-lite`, `packages/design`, `packages/appserver`,
`packages/sdk`, plus a new tile-loading service (see §8).

**Path choice.** This document lives at `docs/plans/web-tiles-integration.md`.
The root `docs/plans/` directory holds cross-package plan documents
(`richtext-migration-plan.md`, `voice-chat-plan.md`, `bluesky-publishing.md`);
this work touches four packages plus a new deployment target, so the root
directory is correct.

## 0. What this document is

Three sources are collated here:

1. **`docs/plans/web-tiles-roomy-feasibility.md`** (2026-08-31) — a
   feasibility read on the DASL Web Tiles spec. Accurate about the spec and the
   security model; written against the deleted `packages/app` (SQLite-WASM +
   Leaf) architecture, so its §3 ("Mapping onto Roomy's architecture"), its
   integration points and its phase plan are stale. §2 of this document is
   that document's spec summary, corrected to the current spec; §4 replaces
   its architecture section; §11 replaces its phase plan.
2. **A design discussion thread** on room context, custom rooms, tile data
   storage, and the tension between tile capabilities and OAuth scopes. §6, §7
   and §9 draw on it.
3. **A funded implementation proposal** — a two-week stint against the spec
   and the `@dasl/tile-*` tooling, with upstream issues/PRs filed as rough
   edges are hit, and a 30-day engagement write-up. §1 and §11.
4. **A later refinement to the sequencing** — that rendering support comes
   first, in two self-contained checkpoints: standalone tiles whose assets are
   entirely in the manifest and which need no host data, then tiles that accept
   only data attached to the message. §11.1 is that plan; it sits ahead of
   feature 1 and does not depend on it. The message-attached data is carried as
   a new `Attachment` variant, not as an extension key (§5.3).

The old document's headline conclusion survives: Web Tiles are a good
conceptual fit for Roomy, and the hard parts are infrastructural and
governance-related rather than conceptual. Two of its three stated blockers
have since changed:

| Old claim | Now |
|---|---|
| "The spec does not yet define the room-context / query-capability channel… that's presently a stub." | **Partly resolved.** Tiles Protocols is now specified and the **Data Passing** protocol (`data.js`) is written, with a concrete `postMessage` contract (§2.4). The self-editing-tiles protocol (`store.js`) is still an `XXX` stub. The old document's "you'd be designing this yourselves" is now "you'd be implementing a published protocol, and only the store half is unclaimed". |
| "You need to run a tile-loading server." | **Unchanged and still the largest new operational surface.** No tile-loading server, wildcard DNS or wildcard TLS exists anywhere in this repo (§8.1). |
| "The main trust decision is administrative: which tiles a space may load, with what capabilities." | **Unchanged**, but the mechanism is now clearer: a per-space allowlist is a materialised space setting, on the `sidebar_config` precedent (§6.4), and is *not* an OAuth scope (§9). |

**What has not changed:** nothing in this repo depends on DASL, and no code for
tiles exists. `grep` for `dasl|masl|atile|tile-loader` across
`packages/appserver/src` and `packages/sdk/src` returns nothing; `pnpm-lock.yaml`
has no `@dasl/*` entry.

---

## 1. The stint

A focused two-week stint using the Web Tiles spec to build extensibility
features in Roomy, testing both the spec and the `@dasl/tile-*` tooling.
Rough edges that surface in the spec or the packages get upstream issues or
PRs.

Two features, in order:

1. **Rich ATProto embeds via Web Tiles** (§5). Roomy today does basic link
   previews for ATProto-resolvable links, from OpenGraph/oEmbed metadata that
   ignores the record entirely. The target is the full pipeline: resolve an
   AT-URI → tile manifest → tile-loading-server → sandboxed render. First
   content type is a Bluesky-compatible post, so a link renders a rich card
   instead of a flat preview. The same pattern then extends to profiles,
   standard.site docs, Semble cards, and other Atmospheric content types.
2. **A room-context tile** (§6). Rooms gain arbitrary context metadata — a
   link to an ATProto calendar event, a task, a code issue — with a mapping
   from particular context data to a Web Tile rendered in a navbar slot, and
   dynamic response to changes in the room's state.

**Within the two weeks:** one context type end to end (calendar events), with
feature 1 landed first. Other context types are a stretch goal.

**Sequencing.** Before either feature, two smaller milestones prove the render
pipeline on their own (§11.1): **A**, a standalone tile whose assets are all in
its manifest and which needs no host data, and **B**, a tile that receives
arbitrary JSON attached to the message as a new `Attachment` variant carrying the
tile's AT-URI. Both are self-contained checkpoints — the first isolates the
loading domain and the sandbox, the second isolates the message-payload path —
and both render a tile from an AT-URI that is already known, so neither depends
on feature 1's link-to-tile resolution work.

**Deliverables.** A working Bluesky-post tile in Roomy; a first version of the
room-context tile; a short write-up of the experience with the spec and the
limitations encountered; links to upstream issues and PRs.

**Longer term, not this stint.** Third-party and user-built tiles, an in-app
tiles marketplace, and the other patterns sketched in the design thread
(custom rooms with full-screen tiles, §6.2; composer takeover, §7.5). The
stint's purpose is to establish what tile-based UX in a chat context actually
needs.

**Additional request.** A short write-up at the **30-day mark** on how users
are actually engaging with tiles: how often they are used, what they are used
for, what is ignored, what surprised us. This needs light,
privacy-respecting instrumentation in Roomy (§10).

## 2. Web Tiles, as of 2026-10-01

The DASL project publishes the spec at `https://dasl.ing/tiles.html`
("stabilising"). Everything below is from that document and its companions.

### 2.1 What a tile is

A tile is a bundle of web content — HTML, JS, CSS, data — described by a
**manifest**. The manifest is a MASL document in Bundle Mode: it needs a
`name` and a `resources` map, and `resources` must include a `/` entry for the
root document. That is the whole requirement.

Two publication mechanisms:

- **On AT Protocol.** Every entry in `resources` is uploaded as a blob to the
  relevant PDS, and the manifest is posted as a record (lexicon `ing.dasl.masl`,
  key `tid`). Because a PDS tracks uploaded blobs rather than arbitrary CIDs,
  each `resources[path].src` must use **`$type: "blob"`** with a `ref.$link`,
  a correct `size` in bytes, and a `mimeType` — not a bare CID link. The spec
  recommends `application/octet-stream` for `mimeType` wherever possible, and
  warns it may not match the entry's separate `content-type`.
- **As a CAR file** (conventionally `.tile`), self-contained, for offline or
  non-AT distribution. All resources live in the CAR and the CAR header is the
  MASL metadata.

Optional manifest fields that matter for a catalogue: `description`,
`categories`, `icons`, `screenshots`, `sizing` (declared width and height),
`theme_color`, `short_name`, and `prev` (the previous version's CID).

The lexicon cannot describe `resources` — it is declared `"type": "unknown"` —
because it is an open path→resource map. The record `main` requires `cid`
(the DRISL CID of the MASL), `tile` (the MASL content) and `createdAt`.

### 2.2 The execution context

A tile runs in a context that must meet a mandated header set. The load-bearing
parts:

```
content-security-policy:
    default-src 'self' blob: data:;
    script-src  'self' blob: data: 'unsafe-inline' 'wasm-unsafe-eval';
    script-src-attr 'none';
    style-src   'self' blob: data: 'unsafe-inline';
    form-src 'self';
    manifest-src 'none';
    object-src 'none';
    base-uri 'none';
    sandbox allow-downloads allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups
            allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts
cross-origin-opener-policy: same-origin
cross-origin-resource-policy: cross-origin
origin-agent-cluster: ?1
permissions-policy: interest-cohort=(), browsing-topics=()
referrer-policy: no-referrer
x-content-type-options: nosniff
x-dns-prefetch-control: off
```

The design move is that **there is no network access beyond what the manifest
pre-declares**: `default-src` and `script-src` admit only `'self'`, `blob:`
and `data:`, so there is no external origin a tile could `fetch` to. Exfiltration
is closed by construction rather than by trust. The spec explicitly frames tiles
as therefore suitable for **private data contexts** — chat, agents — where an
ordinary `<iframe>` would be too dangerous to point at arbitrary third-party
content. That framing is why the spec's own motivating example is "a poll tile
in a group chat app".

`allow-same-origin` alongside `allow-scripts` normally defeats `sandbox`, and
here it is safe only because the CSP has already removed the escape hatch. This
is load-bearing and is the subject of an open upstream dispute (§3.2).

### 2.3 Why a per-tile origin, and what it costs the deployer

Browsers give no way to sandbox strongly enough *within* one origin, so each
tile instance gets **its own origin** — today a random subdomain; the spec notes
it may later be derived from the CID. That is the entire job of the **tile
loading server**: it serves the loader runtime under the hardened headers and
redirects each load onto a fresh random subdomain.

`@dasl/tile-server` implements exactly this, and its README states the
operational consequences plainly: you point `load.<host>` and `*.<host>` at it
(**wildcard DNS + wildcard TLS**), and you set `loadDomain: "load.<host>"` on
the mothership. It never sees or stores tile content; it serves fixed runtime
assets only.

### 2.4 Tiles Protocols — the capability channel, now specified

Tiles Protocols are how a tile reaches capabilities the host chooses to expose.
A protocol is loaded from a reserved path, `/.well-known/web-tiles/<name>.js`,
by the same convention in every tile:

```js
try {
  const protocolApi = await import("/.well-known/web-tiles/some-protocol.js");
  // use it
} catch (err) {
  // the environment doesn't support this protocol
}
```

The host environment supplies the implementation, so the tile uses it as a
black box and never assumes a given environment. In web contexts the transport
is `postMessage` across the tile boundary, with an `action` field prefixed
`tiles-protocol-up-` (tile → host) or `tiles-protocol-down-` (host → tile), and
a `payload` field carrying structured-cloneable data.

Registered resource names: `index.html`, `shuttle.js`, `worker.js` (all
reserved, loader-internal), **`data.js`** (Data Passing), and **`store.js`**
(Self-Editing Tiles).

**Data Passing** (`tp-data`, "hot new stuff") is written and is the one protocol
Roomy needs first. Its interface:

- `addDataHandler(handler)` / `removeDataHandler(handler)` — receive host data.
- `listen()` — tell the host the tile is ready.
- `sendData(payload)` — send data back to the host.

On the web runtime the mapping is: `listen()` sends
`tiles-protocol-up-data-ready` with no payload; host data arrives as
`tiles-protocol-down-data-payload`; `sendData()` emits
`tiles-protocol-up-data-payload`.

**Self-Editing Tiles** (`tp-editable`) is a stub — its body is `XXX` prose. This
is the protocol a tile would use to read and write "the tile's store", and it is
directly relevant to §6's room-state question and to §7.4's storage design. It is
unclaimed.

### 2.5 The client toolkit

`@dasl/tiles` is a meta-package (2.0.0) re-exporting the focused packages under
the original `@dasl/tiles/*` paths; the packages' READMEs recommend depending on
the smaller packages directly.

| Package | Provides |
|---|---|
| `@dasl/tile-loader` | `TileMothership`, `Tile`, the loader classes; browser-only |
| `@dasl/tile-server` | `createTileLoadingRouter(baseHost)` (Express router) and the `tiles-loading-server` CLI |
| `@dasl/tile-writer` | Write tiles into `.tile` (CAR) files |
| `@dasl/tile-car-reader` | Read tiles from a CAR |
| `@dasl/tile-lexicon` | MASL schema and shared types |
| `@dasl/atile` | The tile-publishing CLI |

The loader's shape, verbatim from its README:

```js
const tl = new TileMothership({ loadDomain: 'load.webtiles.example' });
tl.init();
tl.addLoader(new ATTileLoader());

const tile = await tl.loadTile('at://did:plc:…/ing.dasl.masl/3mcjwwoqjqs2v');
document.body.append(await tile.renderCard());   // metadata-only, cheap
document.body.append(tile.renderContent());      // sandboxed iframe
```

`renderCard()` is metadata-only and is explicitly safe to render in bulk;
`renderContent()` spins up the sandboxed context and should be deferred until
the user expands or interacts.

Three layers cooperate over `postMessage`:

- **Mothership** — in the host page. Holds every privileged capability
  (fetching, file access) and resolves the worker's `resolve-path` requests
  against the manifest. The README states the contract: it answers with
  `{ status, headers, body }` and never anything else.
- **Shuttle** — a sandboxed iframe on a fresh random origin, served by the tile
  server. It installs the service worker and hosts the tile's own inner iframe,
  relaying messages. It exists only because a service worker needs a real page
  origin.
- **Worker** — a service worker that intercepts the tile's resource requests
  and defers each to the mothership.

Loaders are tried in order: `ATTileLoader` (`at://…`), `CARTileLoader` and
`WebXDCTileLoader` (`http(s)://…`), `MemoryTileLoader` (`memory://<id>`, for
tests), with `ContentSchemeTileLoader` as the base class for HTTP-fetching
loaders. `TileLoader` and `TilePathLoader` are exported so Roomy can write its
own if needed.

### 2.6 The AT vocabulary already exists in the tree

`@dasl/tile-loader` depends on `@atcute/car@^6` and `@atcute/cid@^2.4.1`.
`@atcute/cid` is already a transitive dependency of this repo (via the ATProto
stack), and `@atcute/cbor` is used directly in `packages/sdk` (for example
`import { fromBytes } from "@atcute/cbor"` in `packages/sdk/src/schema/events/page.ts:4`).
So the CID/CAR/CBOR layer is not a new dependency category for Roomy.

---

## 3. The security model, and what is still open

### 3.1 What you trust

Only two things: the **tile-loading server** (to attach the correct headers and
to not itself misbehave), and **Roomy's own mothership code** (to expose only
the capability surface it intends). The tile's JavaScript is explicitly not
trusted, which is the point of the design.

The spec states the loading server should be "a server trusted by the user…
that cannot learn more than what the embedding context already knows". It is a
redirect-and-headers service that never sees tile content — a good fit for a
small separately-deployed service, and explicitly not something that belongs
inside the appserver's trust boundary.

### 3.2 Open upstream dispute: the mandated header set

`darobin/dasl.ing#98` **"Unsafe sandbox"** (open, opened 2026-03-23, last
updated 2026-08-06) argues the published headers "allow side channel attacks and
possibly sandbox escape", citing the Peergos implementation as prior art, and
lists:

1. Missing `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp`, so no cross-origin
   isolation.
2. `blob:` and `data:` as `script-src` sources are dangerous.
3. The same for `default-src`.
4. `allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox` is dangerous and can bypass the CSP to make
   arbitrary network requests.
5. `form-src` is not a valid CSP directive.
6. Recommendation: add `connect-src: self` or `none`.

This is unresolved. It does not block the stint — Roomy is *consuming* the
model, not certifying it — but it does mean the security story in §3.1 is the
spec's claim, not an independently verified property, and it is exactly the kind
of thing the stint's write-up and upstream issue list should carry. If Roomy
ships a `loadDomain`, this is the header set it serves, deliberately, and the
document should say so rather than imply the model is settled.

A second thread, `darobin/dasl.ing#43` (bnewbold), is directly about the AT
publishing path: it proposes reserving or profiling `atproto-ref` (an AT-URI
alongside the CID) and `atproto-blob` norms, since for a **record** you usually
want the AT-URI too, and for a **blob** only a `$type: "blob"` reference keeps
the blob from being garbage-collected. The reply suggests this may belong in a
tutorial/profile rather than the core spec. §5.2 depends on the AT-URI question.

### 3.3 The remaining trust question

Because a tile is otherwise network-dead, **the capability channel is the entire
attack surface**. That is a good property: the security review concentrates on
one boundary (the protocol surface Roomy implements) instead of on "what could
this arbitrary JavaScript do". It also means every capability Roomy exposes must
be decided deliberately, and §7 is where those decisions live.

---

## 4. Roomy's integration surface today

Thin client, no client-side materialisation. `packages/app-lite` (SvelteKit,
Svelte 5 runes, TanStack Query) reads the appserver over XRPC HTTP
(`DirectXrpcClient`) and receives row-level diffs over a single WebSocket
(`#messageDiff` and friends). The appserver materialises ATProto events into
per-space SQLite and serves XRPC. `packages/app` no longer exists.

Four surfaces matter for this work.

### 4.1 Message rendering — where a tile block would attach

A message body is one of two things: legacy `text/markdown`, or
`application/vnd.roomy.richtext+json` — a base64-encoded JSON document
`{ $type: "space.roomy.richtext.document", blocks: [...] }` carried inside the
event's `body.data` bytes. The event schema was deliberately not changed for
rich text; the document's own `$type` lives inside the bytes, and validation
happens only at `deserializeBody`, which checks `Array.isArray(parsed.blocks)`.

- **Dispatcher:** `packages/app-lite/src/lib/components/chat/MessageContent.svelte:22-34`
  branches on `mimeType === RICHTEXT_MIME` and renders either `<BlocksRenderer>`
  or sanitized markdown.
- **The block switch:**
  `packages/app-lite/src/lib/components/chat/BlocksRenderer.svelte:190-223` is a
  flat `{#if block.$type === …}` chain over text, header, blockquote, small,
  code, orderedList, unorderedList, image and horizontalRule. **An unmatched
  `$type` renders nothing.**
- **The open union:**
  `packages/sdk/src/schema/richtext/index.ts:203-207` defines
  `UnknownBlock = { $type: string, text?: string }`, and `Block`
  (`:213-224`) ends with it. This is the only sanctioned way a non-standard
  block survives decoding, and it is documented as being dropped by renderers.
- **Wrapper:** `BlocksRenderer`'s root is `display: contents`
  (`:188`, style `:230-235`), so block margins come from
  `packages/app-lite/src/lib/message-typography.css`, shared with the composer.
- **Host and slots:** `packages/design/src/components/content/thread/message/MessageBubble.svelte`
  declares snippet slots `replyContext | content | media | linkEmbeds |
  forwardEmbed | toolbar | reactions | actions | deliveryActions |
  selectionIndicator` (`:47-56`) and renders them at `:373-387`. `ChatMessage.svelte`
  supplies them at `:498-564`; `ActivityFeed.svelte` and `SearchResultsList.svelte`
  supply the same shape.

**Consequence for tiles.** A tile block needs an explicit arm in
`BlocksRenderer`; the open union makes it *survive* the wire, not *render*.
If a tile arrives instead as a new message field (like `linkEmbeds`), the
change reaches `MessageContent`/`MessageBubble` instead. §5.3 picks between
these.

### 4.2 The embed pipeline — what a tile replaces or extends

Link previews are a **server-produced read projection**, not a client fetch:

1. Message materialisation yields URLs (`detectAndStoreLinks`,
   `packages/appserver/src/embed/enricher.ts:578`, called from
   `materialization/applyBatch.ts:605-635`) into `comp_embed_link`, dual-written
   to the global `pending_links` queue. Richtext `#link` facets take the
   sibling path (`detectAndStoreLinksFromUrls`, `enricher.ts:614`).
2. A single process-wide sweeper (`packages/appserver/src/embed/sweeper.ts`,
   started once at `packages/appserver/src/appserver.ts:800`) drains the queue
   and enriches with OpenGraph + oEmbed discovery
   (`packages/appserver/src/embed/metadata.ts:372`, 8s timeout), retrying on a
   1m/5m/30m/2h → 6h schedule with an attempt ceiling.
3. Results land in `comp_embed_link_data.embed_json`
   (`packages/appserver/src/db/schema-space.sql:248-256`) as a JSON-serialised
   `EmbedV1`; `embed_json = NULL` means definitive no-data or abandoned.
4. `selectMessages` hydrates the row into the DTO:
   `linkEmbeds: LinkEmbedDto[]` (`packages/appserver/src/queries/selectMessages.ts:100`,
   assembled `:470-515`, returned `:562`).
5. Live delivery: `emitEnrichmentInvalidation`
   (`packages/appserver/src/embed/sweeper.ts:1527-1604`) resolves
   link → message → room and emits `#messageDiff` updates plus
   `room.getLinks` / `space.getLinks` invalidations.
6. The client just renders the array. The DTO field is
   `Message.linkEmbeds: LinkEmbed[]` (`packages/sdk/src/schemas/queries/_message.ts:128`),
   drawn by `packages/design/src/components/content/thread/message/embeds/LinkCard.svelte`,
   whose call sites are `ChatMessage.svelte:619-635`, `ActivityFeed.svelte:229-235`,
   `SearchResultsList.svelte:434-443`, and the Links view
   (`design/…/linkView/LinkViewItem.svelte`).

There is also a **synchronous** enrichment path for the composer and the
in-place editor: `space.roomy.embed.getLinkMetadata` (registered at
`packages/appserver/src/appserver.ts:490-493`; handler
`packages/appserver/src/handlers/space.roomy.embed.getLinkMetadata.ts`; schema
`packages/sdk/src/schemas/queries/getLinkMetadata.ts`), called from
`packages/app-lite/src/lib/embed/embed-service.ts:56-64`.

**The seam.** `metadata.ts`'s own doc comment says the pipeline is
"deliberately self-contained… so ATProto-native enrichment can later be layered
on top of the same endpoint without changing the interface". That is precisely
what feature 1 is: the current enrich path learns only what a URL's HTML says.
Neither path knows the URL is an AT-URI.

### 4.3 UI slots a tile can occupy

| Slot | Owner | How a tile attaches |
|---|---|---|
| Navbar (right-hand content) | `layout/navbar.svelte.ts` `setNavbar` (`:39`); region `layout/MainLayout.svelte:150-153` | Room page already calls `setNavbar(roomNavbar)` at `routes/[space]/[room]/+page.svelte:161`, snippet at `:384-412` |
| Navbar (space-info, right of the breadcrumb) | `setSpaceInfoExtra` (`navbar.svelte.ts:56`), rendered `MainLayout.svelte:135-141`; in settings at `routes/[space]/settings/+layout.svelte:81-83` | Precedent: the Discord bridge status badge |
| Sidebar | `layout/sidebar.svelte.ts` (`setSidebarContent:34`, `setSidebar:48`, `setSidebarHeader:63`); region `MainLayout.svelte:188-238` | A pinned custom room (§7.3) |
| Composer | `ChatInputArea.svelte:513-596` assembles the design shell; shell contract `design/…/ChatInputShell.svelte:85-92` (`contextPreview`/`input`/`linkEmbedPreview`/`fullscreenDropper`) | A new snippet, not a forked editor |
| Room tab panel | `routes/[space]/[room]/+page.svelte:417-434`, tab list `:320-329` (precedent: the `links-view`-flagged Links tab) | A tile panel beside Chat/Threads/Links |

Note the room page mounts `ChatArea` and `ChannelBoardView` simultaneously and
toggles visibility — a tile panel should follow that pattern so its state
survives tab switches.

### 4.4 What does not exist yet, and the two that bite

- **No iframe anywhere.** `grep` for `iframe|srcdoc|sandbox=` across
  `packages/app-lite/src` and `packages/design/src` returns zero matches. The
  only iframe-adjacent code is server-side *string parsing*
  (`embed/metadata.ts:194-197` pulls `src` out of oEmbed `html`), and video is
  rendered as a plain `<video src>` (`LinkCard.svelte:89-99`), never a frame.
  The sandbox host is new code.
- **No CSP anywhere in app-lite's delivery path.** `src/app.html` declares none,
  `packages/app-lite/svelte.config.js` sets no `kit.csp`, `Caddyfile` has no
  `header` directive and `netlify.toml` has no `[[headers]]` block. So a tile
  iframe's `sandbox` attribute would be the *only* containment, with no
  host-page CSP to lean on — and, more sharply, an `allow-same-origin` tile
  served from the `roomy.space` origin would be same-origin as the app. **The
  load domain must be a different origin.** See §8.1.
- **The app already registers a service worker.**
  `svelte.config.js` sets `serviceWorker.register: true` and
  `packages/app-lite/src/service-worker.ts:88` installs a fetch handler scoped
  by URL. A tile's shuttle/worker is registered by the tile server under the
  *load* origin, so the two do not collide — but the loader's architecture
  exists because of service-worker origin rules, and the app's SW is a
  pre-existing moving part to keep in mind when debugging.
- **The appserver is `Bun.serve`, not Express.** `@dasl/tile-server` ships an
  Express router. Serving the tile-loading role from the appserver process
  would mean porting the router or hosting an Express app inside Bun; §8.1
  recommends a separate service instead.
- **`getLinkMetadata` returns only the embed shape.** The response is
  `LinkEmbedData` (`getLinkMetadata.ts:41-52`) and an empty object for a URL
  with no metadata. Anything a tile needs (the resolved AT-URI, the manifest's
  name/description/sizing) has no field to travel in today.

### 4.5 Adding things to the appserver, for reference

- **XRPC query/procedure:** register in the `.query()/.procedure()` chain in
  `packages/appserver/src/appserver.ts:207-546` (exemplar: the room-metadata
  query at `:432-436`); handler in `packages/appserver/src/handlers/`; SDK
  schema in `packages/sdk/src/schemas/{queries,procedures}/` plus its `index.ts`
  re-export and a `transport/registry.ts` entry; then
  `pnpm --filter @roomy-space/sdk generate:lexicons`, which CI enforces
  (`check:lexicons`).
- **Non-XRPC HTTP route** (the shape a tile endpoint or proxy would take): the
  `Bun.serve` fetch in `appserver.ts:1024-1250`. The existing precedent is
  `/blob/<did>/<cid>` (`:1236-1245`), backed by `proxyBlob`
  (`packages/appserver/src/blob.ts:25-79`), which resolves DID → PDS via
  `resolvePdsEndpoint` and forwards `Range`, with
  `cache-control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`. It is unauthenticated
  by design.
- **New event type:** schema file in `packages/sdk/src/schema/events/`, added to
  that family's variant union, to `envelope.ts`, and to `eventRegistry`
  (`events/registry.ts:61-108`, whose `satisfies` makes a missing registration a
  type error) — plus, in the appserver, `auth/writeAuth.ts` `ALLOWED_TYPES`
  (hand-maintained) and an auth category, or the event is rejected at runtime
  with a 400. Missing any of these produces the known
  `no materializer for event` failure mode, where the event is skipped but the
  cursor still advances.
- **Outbound ATProto fetching to reuse:** `blob.ts` (blob proxy),
  `identity.ts` `resolvePdsEndpoint` (`:142-153`, 1h-stale/24h-max DID cache),
  and exactly one `com.atproto.repo.getRecord` call
  (`materialization/roomyProfile.ts:88-108`, hardcoded to
  `space.roomy.user.profile/self`). **There is no general AT-URI → record
  resolver**, so resolving `at://did/ing.dasl.masl/<tid>` is new code — though
  it is a small, direct use of `com.atproto.repo.getRecord` plus the existing
  DID→PDS resolution and timeout helpers (`fetchTimeout.ts:38-46`).

## 5. Feature 1 — rich ATProto embeds via Web Tiles

### 5.1 The gap

A Roomy message containing `https://bsky.app/profile/<handle>/post/<rkey>`
renders whatever the page's OpenGraph tags say. The ATProto record behind it is
never consulted. The result is a flat preview at best and, for sites that block
bots or serve less metadata to non-browser agents, nothing.

### 5.2 What "rich" means concretely

Resolve an AT-URI to a record; render that record with a tile. The first content
type is a Bluesky post, which means:

1. **Recognise** that a URL is ATProto-resolvable (a `bsky.app` post link, an
   `at://` URI, and later a profile link, a standard.site doc, a Semble card).
2. **Resolve** the AT-URI to an `ing.dasl.masl` record — `com.atproto.repo.getRecord`
   against the DID's PDS, reusing `resolvePdsEndpoint` and the existing timeout
   helpers. Cache, because PDS round-trips are the cost this pipeline pays.
3. **Load** the manifest's resources through the tile loading server, and
   **render** it sandboxed.

Note that (2) is a **tile** lookup, not the post lookup: the pipeline is
"an AT-URI (a post link) → which tile renders this content type → that tile's
manifest". The mapping from "content type" to "tile" is the interesting design
question and is §5.4.

Two AT-publishing details carry over from `darobin/dasl.ing#43`: for a *record*
reference the AT-URI is wanted alongside the CID, and the manifest's blob
entries must use `$type: "blob"` or the PDS will garbage-collect the resources.

### 5.3 Where the result lands

The question is how a tile reaches a message. Three candidate shapes, in
increasing order of blast radius:

- **(a) Extend the existing embed projection.** The AT-URI resolution becomes a
  second enrichment source feeding `comp_embed_link_data`, and
  `LinkEmbedData` grows the fields a tile card needs; the client's `LinkCard`
  renders a `TileCard` when those fields are present. Keeps the current
  rendering, the `#messageDiff` delivery, the retry/backoff machinery and the
  live-update path for free. Requires an SDK DTO change and a projection change.
- **(b) A tile attachment** — a new variant in the `Attachment` union carrying
  the tile's AT-URI and a payload. This is the composed-with-the-message shape,
  it survives edits, and it rides the read path messages already have. It is
  what milestone B builds (§11.1), and it is the shape that generalises: the
  same attachment carries a Bluesky renderer's tile, a Mermaid renderer's
  source, or a poll's options.
- **(c) A richtext block** (`space.roomy.richtext.blocks#tile`), so a tile is
  authored into the message body. This is the "tile block" idea from the design
  thread — drop an AT-URI into the editor and it renders. It requires an
  explicit arm in `BlocksRenderer` and a new block type in the SDK's open union.

These are not exclusive. The thread's own conclusion is worth recording: it
distinguishes an **attachment** from a **block**, and lands on attachment as the
better home for a tile produced by interacting with an input tile in the
composer ("you drop an 'input tile', and by interacting with it you produce
metadata attached to the message, which a renderer tile then renders").
`Attachment` is also the more natural carrier for *data*: a block is part of the
message body and is edited as text, whereas an attachment is a structured
sidecar with its own materialised row, its own DTO field and its own renderer —
which is what a tile with a payload needs.

So the division of labour is: **(b) is how a tile is attached to a message**,
**(a) is how a resolvable link is turned into a card** without the author
attaching anything, and **(c) remains open** for composing a tile inline as
message content. Feature 1's first cut is (b) plus (a); (c) is not needed for
either funded feature.

Two facts about the attachment route that a reader should not have to rediscover,
both verified against the built SDK and detailed in §11.1: the `Attachment`
union is **closed**, so an unknown `$type` is rejected at `parseEvent` — a tile
attachment is a real schema change, not a passthrough; and `updateRoom`'s sibling
gap does not apply here, because the message edit path *does* carry attachments
but must be given an explicit branch for the new variant.

### 5.4 The content-type → tile mapping

Options, none settled:

- **By publisher allowlist.** A per-space (or per-org) list of tile publishers
  or handles whose tiles may render. Simple, and matches §6.4's governance
  shape.
- **By explicit AT-URI.** The space pins specific tiles: "this is our Bluesky
  post renderer". Maximum control, minimum flexibility.
- **By convention.** A Roomy-published set of default tiles, overridable per
  space. This is the version that makes the feature feel like a product rather
  than a configuration exercise — and it is what a marketplace (§12) would
  eventually replace.

The thread's framing is that a first cut can be less of an open extension point
and more a proof of the system: inject the tile ref we want to load, resolve it,
render it, and learn what the pipeline needs. That is the right posture for two
weeks.

### 5.5 Where resolution happens

Two candidate sites, and the old document's answer is still right:

- **Client-side** — the mothership holds the fetch capability anyway, and the
  loader is client code.
- **Appserver-side** — "probably preferable" per the design thread, and
  consistent with the thin-client architecture: app-lite holds no third-party
  credentials and makes no unsanctioned external calls, and the server already
  has DID→PDS resolution, HTTP caching and timeouts.

The split that fits the codebase: **the appserver resolves and caches the
manifest metadata** (so the card renders server-side with everything else, and
survives `#messageDiff` delivery), and **the client holds the mothership** (so
the sandboxed content loads where the DOM is, with the loader's own fetch path
for resources). That is also how the existing embed pipeline divides: the server
enriches, the client renders.

---

## 6. Feature 2 — the room context tile

### 6.1 The idea

Rooms gain arbitrary **context metadata**: a link to an ATProto calendar event,
a task, a code issue. Particular context data maps to a Web Tile rendered in a
navbar slot, and the tile responds dynamically to changes in the room's state.

Concrete motivating cases from the design thread:

- **Bridged rooms** — show bridge/backfill status, especially useful to admins.
- **Linked work** — a room tied to a Tangled or GitHub issue or PR, showing
  relevant data and a link.
- **Agent rooms** — display the current state of the agent and what thread it is
  working in, plus controls (a stop button, a model selector).
- **Events** — the calendar case, chosen as the stint's first context type.

### 6.2 The shapes the thread settled on

- **Room context metadata** — arbitrary, per-room, and it **overlaps and
  expires**: several independent context declarations can be active at once.
- **Room context tile** — a tile rendered in a navbar slot and driven by that
  metadata.
- **Chat input tile** — a tile that *overrides or augments the composer*: a game
  claims the room context and replaces the input with game-relevant UI.
- **Custom rooms** (formerly "data rooms") — a room whose data is tile-managed,
  which the thread also imagines pinned to the sidebar with a full-screen tile
  (a document you can scrub through history; a graph view of the space's data).

### 6.3 The partitioning problem, and how it resolves

The thread's sharpest observation is about **partitioning**. If "user A started
a chess game" and "user B created a poll" coexist in one room, those are
independent state dimensions — and the user is the *wrong* partition. The
application is the right one.

The resolution reached: **a top-level key-value store per room, keyed by NSID**.
A tile application owns a key namespace; the value is arbitrary JSON and it is
the tile's job to manage it. This maps cleanly onto three things:

- **`space.roomy.room.updateRoom` cannot carry it.** `UpdateRoomSchema`
  (`packages/sdk/src/schema/events/room.ts:91-100`) has no `extensions` field at
  all; only `CreateRoomSchema` does (`:47-56`), with a single-variant
  `RoomExtensionMap` (`extensions/room.ts:31-37`). So a room's metadata cannot
  be extended after creation with the current schema — this is a real, specific
  change the feature needs.
- **The `extensions` map is the existing mechanism.** `unionToMap`
  (`primitives.ts:111-140`) derives a `$type`-keyed optional map from an
  extension union, so a new extension type is added to the union and the map
  field picks it up with no change to any event schema. Extensions exist only as
  ArkType schemas — no lexicon JSON — so the whole change is one file plus its
  union membership.
- **Room metadata is SQL columns, not a record.** `comp_room` (label,
  default_access, deleted) and `comp_info` (name, avatar, description, banner,
  pronouns, website) are typed columns; there is **no generic JSON column on a
  room**. The nearest precedent is `comp_space.sidebar_config text not null
  default '{"categories": []}'` (`packages/appserver/src/db/schema-space.sql:113`),
  written by `space.roomy.space.updateSidebar.v0/v1` and parsed in
  `handlers/space.roomy.space.getMetadata.ts:137-165`. A `room_context` JSON
  column plus a room-context event mirrors that 1:1.

### 6.4 Governance, and where an allowlist lives

Tiles are content-addressed and network-dead, so the trust decision is
administrative: which tiles may this space load, and with what capabilities.
Three precedent-backed homes:

1. **A space-level JSON config column**, materialised by a new event — the
   `sidebar_config` pattern.
2. **A component table** (`comp_tile`), like `comp_discord_origin`
   (`schema-space.sql:138-143`), when entries need querying or ordering.
3. **A read-state table** when the setting is per-user and must survive
   materialisation resets — the `bridge_token_grants` precedent.

Admin gating for the write follows `space.roomy.space.updatePolicy.ts:52-60`
(`requireSpaceAccess` + `access.isAdmin` → 403).

The thread's additional wrinkle: the default permission is "a tile may write to
its own namespaced store", which is unobjectionable because the host enforces
the namespace. The contested case is a tile that must write to *public* records
— RSVPs, votes, board-game moves — which is a capability grant, and is §9.

### 6.5 The calendar case, concretely

Roomy already has a calendar-shaped event and no consumer for it. `space.roomy.openmeet.configure.v0`
(`packages/sdk/src/schema/events/calendar.ts:14-24`) writes `comp_calendar_link`
(`schema-space.sql:279`), is in `writeAuth.ALLOWED_TYPES`, and has an
`inferSignals` entry — but there is **no handler, no SDK query schema, and no
client code**. Two calendar NSIDs appear in `packages/app-lite/src/lib/scopes.ts:112-113`
(`space.roomy.space.getCalendarLink`, `space.roomy.space.getCalendarEvents`)
with no implementation behind them.

That makes calendar events a good forcing function: the room context has
somewhere to come from, the RPC shape is already imagined in the scope list, and
an ATProto calendar event (an event record with a time, a location and an RSVP
surface) is a realistic first tile — including the RSVP write, which is where
§9's capability question gets its first concrete instance.

---

## 7. Roomy's tile protocol surface

The spec's decision tree deliberately does not make "prompt the user" the
load-bearing gate for dangerous capabilities, on the grounds that asking users
to evaluate permission requests has repeatedly failed. Capabilities are
something the host grants, not something the tile obtains.

That means every capability Roomy exposes is a design decision here. The
candidates, with the current state of each:

1. **Data in** (§7.1) — required for every use case. `tp-data` is published.
2. **Room reads** (§7.2) — "make specified queries against the room".
3. **Room writes** (§7.3) — send to a custom room; send to the space proper.
4. **Storage** (§7.4) — the per-tile KV store. `tp-editable` is an `XXX` stub.
5. **Composer takeover** (§7.5) — the chat input tile.
6. **Live media** (§7.6) — streaming video, which the model cannot express.

### 7.1 Data in

`tp-data` (§2.4) is the whole answer for passing the host's data into the tile
and getting results back. For feature 1 the payload is the resolved record; for
feature 2 it is the room context and the room's derived state. `addDataHandler`
on the tile side, `tiles-protocol-down-data-payload` on the wire, and the
mothership implements the host half.

### 7.2 Room reads

The thread's shape: a small set of **read-only query verbs** the mothership
implements against the appserver's materialised views —
`getRecentMessages(n)`, `getMembers()`, `getThread(id)` — never direct
database or event-log access.

Two observations sharpen this. First, the thread debates whether tiles need room
message access at all, and concludes it is not a security concern: tiles are
already sandboxed and cannot exfiltrate. The question is therefore about
*design cleanliness and cost*, not safety. Second, and this matters for the
stint: **the extra compute should happen mostly on the client**. The appserver's
API is deliberately denormalised to the frontend's needs rather than being
general-purpose, and the thread's conclusion is that this is fine — the Roomy
API may stay specific to the Roomy client, and anything needing to *index*
extended data can use another AppView. So a room-read capability is best served
by handing the tile data the client already has, rather than by inventing new
appserver endpoints per capability.

### 7.3 Room writes

Two tiers, with a clear line between them:

- **Sandbox writes** — a tile posts into a **custom room** scoped to that tile
  application. If custom rooms map one-to-one onto permissioned spaces, and a
  tile's writes are confined to its own custom room, then the tile effectively
  has a sandbox and needs no explicit user consent. This is the tier the stint
  should build against.
- **Public writes** — a write outside the room: an RSVP to a public record, a
  vote, a board-game move. This needs a grant, and §9 is where that lands.

### 7.4 Storage

The thread converges on "re-implementing browser `localStorage`, but for the
PDS": arbitrary data, namespaced by the tile application, with the host
enforcing that a tile can only write records in its own namespace. The
`store.js` protocol is the spec's name for exactly this, and it is unwritten
(§2.4) — so a Roomy implementation of tile storage is simultaneously a feature
and a candidate upstream contribution, and the stint's write-up should say which
it turned out to be.

The data model the thread sketched: a generic **MASL record** that tiles write
to, with the application's NSID as the record key. This supports arbitrary
functionality, with the remaining constraint being integration with third-party
lexicons.

### 7.5 Composer takeover

Not required by either feature, and the riskiest of the surfaces, because a tile
that controls the composer controls what the user appears to be saying. Worth
noting that the thread's own risk assessment separates it from the others: a
full-screen tile in the sidebar is chosen by an admin and will not be stumbled
into, whereas an interactive embed is more exposed. The composer is further
along that axis still.

### 7.6 Live media

Recorded as a limitation rather than a plan. Streaming video into a chat room
(for example a Streamplace stream) is a good room-context use case, but a tile
cannot stream video — it is network-dead, so the media would have to be piped in
by the host, which is a **new tiles protocol**, not an application of an
existing one. Also noted in the thread: the spec's own packaging discussion
observes that manifest-like loading makes large content (parquet, video)
awkward, which is the same constraint from the other direction.

---

## 8. Infrastructure

### 8.1 The tile loading server

The one genuinely new operational surface. Requirements, per `@dasl/tile-server`:

- Wildcard DNS (`load.<domain>` and `*.<domain>`) and a **wildcard TLS
  certificate**. The spec and the package README both say this is the deployer's
  job.
- The app must know the request's true host behind a proxy
  (`app.set("trust proxy", "loopback")` in the Express example), so the
  redirect target is right.
- The mothership's `loadDomain` points at it.

**Shape.** A small, separately-deployable service. It never sees tile content,
so it does not belong inside the appserver's trust boundary, and it must be a
**different origin** from app-lite (§4.4) — a tile origin that is same-origin
with the app would defeat the sandbox while looking like it worked. Two
implementation options:

- **Run the CLI/service as-is** (`tiles-loading-server <host> <port>`,
  default port 1503) as its own deployment target. Least code; adds a Node/Express
  process to the estate.
- **Re-implement the router** against the appserver's `Bun.serve` fetch handler.
  It is a redirect plus a header set plus serving a fixed set of runtime
  assets, so this is not large — but it is a security-relevant re-implementation
  of someone else's header policy, and any drift is a silent hole.

The recommendation is to run the published service first and consider folding it
in only if deploying a second process proves painful.

**Open decisions.**

- **Central vs per-instance.** One Roomy-operated tile-loading server that all
  instances use by default (simpler for self-hosters, less infra each, one
  wildcard cert) versus every instance running its own (consistent with
  credible-exit posture, more setup burden). A sane default with an easy
  override is the obvious middle.
- **Which domain.** `load.roomy.space` is not available for free: the wildcard
  certificate is a deploy-time change to however `roomy.space` TLS is currently
  issued.

### 8.2 Publishing tiles

`atile` covers publishing from a command line: upload each resource as a blob,
post the manifest as an `ing.dasl.masl` record. Whether tile *publishing* should
also be admin-facing inside Roomy — so community managers can author simple
embeds without touching a CLI — is open, and is the difference between a
"bring your own tile" model and a product. Not in the two weeks.

### 8.3 Build and delivery facts that constrain the deployment

- **app-lite is a static SPA** built by `scripts/build-prod.sh` and served by
  Caddy (`Caddyfile`) or Netlify (`netlify.toml`); the service worker is
  registered and caches assets.
- **`app.bsky.feed.getAuthorFeed` against the public AppView needs no OAuth
  scope** — it is unauthenticated. Reading public Bluesky data is a *fetch*, not
  a *grant*. The repo already calls `api.bsky.app` directly for profile lookups
  (`packages/appserver/src/materialization/profiles.ts:170`), and
  `packages/app-lite/src/lib/last-login.ts:101` calls the AppView from the
  client.
- **`blob:*/*` is already in `BASE_SCOPES`** (`packages/app-lite/src/lib/scopes.ts:192`),
  so a tile fetching its own manifest and blobs from a PDS needs no new scope.

---

## 9. Scopes, consent, and the capability question

This is where the thread spent most of its energy, and where the funded features
must not accidentally overreach.

### 9.1 How Roomy's scopes work today

Two independently-deployed gates, and **neither is enforced by the appserver**:

1. **The PDS metadata ceiling** — `FULL_SCOPE_CEILING`
   (`packages/app-lite/src/lib/scopes.ts:310-348`) is served as
   `oauth-client-metadata.json`. A request for a token missing from it fails
   with `invalid_scope`. It is rebuilt on every deploy from that file.
2. **The HappyView API client's scope allowlist**, provisioned on the HappyView
   instance and read from its database per request. After consent, the client
   posts the granted set to `POST /oauth/sessions`, and HappyView rejects the
   **whole** set if any one token is absent — so one unregistered token blocks
   every login, and the browser surfaces it as
   `OAuthCallbackError: Failed to register session`.

`APPSERVER_RPCS` (`scopes.ts:84-150`) becomes `rpc:<nsid>?aud=*` and rides the
`base` tier. `UNREGISTERED_SCOPES` (`:175-178`), `REQUESTABLE_SCOPE_SETS`
(`:262-272`) and `check-oauth-scopes.mjs` (run in CI at
`.github/workflows/ci.yml:287-288`) enforce that no requestable tier asks for an
unregistered token.

The appserver's scope handling is **storage only**: it records the raw granted
string, serves it back pre-login, and stores change *intents* for the settings
page. No handler checks a scope, and there is no `invalid_scope` path in the
appserver.

### 9.2 The tile-scope problem, stated precisely

The thread's problem: if a tile needs to write to the user's PDS, that is a new
scope. But `oauth-client-metadata.json` is static, so it bounds what *any* tile
could ever request — the ceiling is the union of everything every tile might
need, which is untenable for third-party integrations, and the alternative
(every tile's needs in Roomy's metadata) is what makes the file hard to keep in
sync in the first place.

The consequence identified in the thread is the important one: if Roomy's
metadata says "all write access" so some tile can write a collection not
enumerated there, the user gets an opaque "write access to PDS" consent prompt —
which is precisely the user-evaluates-the-permission failure mode the spec's
decision tree exists to avoid.

### 9.3 The resolution

The thread lands on a **middle ground**, and it is the recommendation here:

- **Default: a namespaced MASL store.** A tile writes only to records namespaced
  by its own application; the host enforces the namespace. This needs no
  expanded consent, and it covers polls, board games, and tile-local state.
- **Exception: whitelisted public writes.** Some tiles genuinely need to write
  to public records — RSVPs being the canonical case. Roomy **whitelists those
  scopes**, in the sense that a tile requesting a PDS write is **manually
  reviewed** before its scopes are added to the metadata and registered with
  HappyView. The thread's own description of this is "like Apple App Store
  review", and it is a governance mechanism rather than a protocol one.
- **Rejected: tiles running their own OAuth flow.** The thread considers it —
  each tile already has its own subdomain, so it could hold a session on the
  tile's host domain — and rejects it, because it "ruins some of the otherwise
  nice sandboxing": a tile with network access and a session is just an iframe,
  and can exfiltrate.

The related upstream wish, recorded for the write-up rather than acted on: it
would be nice if OAuth client metadata could declare `transition:generic` while
requesting narrower scopes at login, but the ceiling is a deliberate PDS-side
constraint and the thread expects it to stay.

### 9.4 The arbiter path, and a live blocker

Roomy spaces are real ATProto accounts on the Roomy PDS, reached through the
arbiter's policy proxy. A write to the space's own repo goes one of two ways:

- **Server-driven** — through the appserver's built-in route.
- **Client-driven** — through `ArbiterClient.proxy` → the scoped route
  (`space.roomy.authComplete.arbiter.proxy`).

The scoped route runs the published permission set's Rego **over the inner
request alone, with no caller identity**, and it **denies `putRecord` of
`app.bsky.feed.post`** — pinned by `packages/appserver/src/arbiter/provision.test.ts:187-218`.
That is an existing, unrelated blocker recorded in
`docs/plans/bluesky-publishing.md` §0.4, and it is worth restating here because
a tile that wants to post on the space's behalf hits exactly the same wall. It
is *not* feature 1's problem: feature 1 **reads** records and renders them, and
reading public Bluesky data needs no scope and no arbiter call.

---

## 10. Instrumentation for the 30-day write-up

The request is for early signal on how users actually engage with tiles: how
often, for what, what is ignored, what surprised us. That needs "light,
privacy-respecting instrumentation".

What exists:

- **`packages/app-lite/src/lib/telemetry/faro.ts`** — Grafana Faro browser
  telemetry, gated on `PUBLIC_FARO_URL` and a **no-op when unset** (the dev and
  default-build configuration). The SDK is dynamically imported so a deployment
  without telemetry pays no payload cost. Its v1 scope is deliberately narrow:
  console interception plus error instrumentation, **no web vitals, no
  tracing**.
- **`packages/app-lite/src/lib/telemetry/scrub.ts`** — every item passes
  through `beforeSend`, which replaces absolute URLs with their host. This
  exists because logged errors routinely carry a request URL, and a
  `com.atproto.server.getServiceAuth` URL carries a signed capability that
  would otherwise be stored permanently.
- **Prometheus metrics** — `packages/appserver/src/metrics.ts`, a
  dependency-free text-format registry served at `/metrics`, with per-endpoint
  latency, pool queue depth, cache hit rate, and embed backlog
  (`roomy_embed_pending`, `roomy_embed_enriched_null`, and the rest, wired at
  `appserver.ts:950-975`).

The gap: **Faro's v1 scope records errors and console output, not product
events.** Counting "how often is a tile expanded" is not something the current
telemetry can answer. Two honest options, and the choice should be made
explicitly rather than drifting into one:

- **Client events via Faro** — a small set of structured events (tile card
  rendered, tile content expanded, tile interaction, tile errored), sent through
  the existing Faro transport and the existing scrubber. No new infrastructure;
  needs a deliberate decision about what identifies an event (a tile CID is
  content, not a person — but a DID or a room id is a person and a place).
- **Server-side counters** — the appserver already counts embed enrichment;
  the same shape would cover manifest resolution and cache behaviour, which is
  operational rather than product signal.

Privacy constraints that should be stated in the instrumentation's own
documentation, not just decided here: no per-user event streams, no message
content, no DIDs in event properties, and the existing `scrub.ts` invariant
holds for anything new. The write-up should report what was measured, what was
deliberately not, and why.

---

## 11. Plan

Two classes of work, sequenced so the self-contained checkpoints land first.

### 11.1 The rendering path (milestones A and B)

These are small, standalone checkpoints that prove the render pipeline before any
of the resolution machinery in §5 exists. Both render a tile from an AT-URI that
Roomy already has — a hand-placed one for A, the tile attachment's own field for
B. Neither needs the *link*-to-tile resolution of feature 1, the content-type
mapping, or the embed projection.

**Milestone A — standalone tiles.** A tile whose assets are all in its manifest
and which takes no data from the host: a static web page, an interactive WebGL
scene. The whole shape is:

1. `TileMothership` in app-lite, `loadDomain` pointed at a loading server (§11.3
   covers which one for a checkpoint), `addLoader(new ATTileLoader())`.
2. A component that takes a tile AT-URI, calls `tl.loadTile(uri)`, appends
   `renderContent()`, and shows the manifest's card via `renderCard()` while
   loading.

Nothing else is needed: `ATTileLoader` fetches the manifest from the PDS and its
`ATPathLoader` (`@dasl/tile-loader/at`) serves each manifest path from that same
PDS. There is no host data channel in the path at all.

This is worth doing first because it isolates the two variables most likely to
waste a fortnight: whether the loading domain is configured correctly
(wildcard DNS, wildcard TLS, `service-worker-allowed: /`, the CSP header set),
and whether the sandbox behaves as the spec claims. It is also the first test of
the upstream concern in §3.2 — if iframe/worker wiring misbehaves, that is
evidence for `darobin/dasl.ing#98`, not a Roomy bug.

**Milestone B — the tile attachment.** A tile receives arbitrary JSON attached
to the message alongside the tile's AT-URI. The motivating case is a Mermaid
renderer: the attachment carries the tile's AT-URI and the diagram source, and
the tile renders it.

The carrier is a new variant in the existing `Attachment` union —
`space.roomy.attachment.tile.v0`, carrying the tile's AT-URI and a payload —
inside the existing `space.roomy.extension.attachments.v0` extension. This is
the "Roomy-native" home for it, and it is the shape that survives edits, is
discoverable in the union, and rides the read path messages already have. The
cost is that it is a **real schema change**, in a fixed set of places.

**The union is closed, so this is not optional — verified, not assumed.** An
attachment whose `$type` is unknown is *rejected* outright. Against the built
SDK:

```
"UNKNOWN tile att, no schema change"
  => FAIL: extensions["space.roomy.extension.attachments.v0"].attachments[0].$type
          must be "space.roomy.attachment.comment.v0", "space.roomy.attachment.file.v0", …
```

So a tile attachment cannot be smuggled through as an unrecognised attachment;
the variant has to be added. (The inverse of this is what made the earlier
`at://`-keyed design a zero-schema-change option. Attachments trade that for a
shape the read path already understands.)

**The touch points, all five of them.** Skipping any one is a silent failure at a
different layer:

| # | Where | What |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `extensions/message.ts:105-113` | Add `TileAttachment` to the `Attachment` union |
| 2 | `events/message.ts:76-77` (create) | A branch writing the attachment to storage |
| 3 | `events/message.ts:305-386` (edit) | The same branch, or edits drop the tile |
| 4 | `queries/selectMessages.ts:333-374` + DTO | The UNION branch, and the field the client reads |
| 5 | `app-lite` / `design` | The component that loads and renders the tile |

`createMessage`'s `attachments` option (`operations/message.ts:35`, `:78-83`) is
already generic over the union, so the SDK operation needs no change — an agent
passing a tile attachment writes it with no new operation and no composer work.

**The edit path is the trap, and it has a precedent for the bug.** The edit
materialiser iterates attachments and, for an unrecognised `$type`, falls
through silently — so a tile attachment would vanish the first time the message
was edited. That is not hypothetical: `space.roomy.attachment.forward.v0` is
handled in the create path (`events/message.ts:161`) and has **no branch in the
edit path** (`events/message.ts:305-386`), so a forward's edge is not rewritten
on edit. Milestone B must not repeat that. There is a second,
narrower trap: an edit carrying *only* link attachments takes a non-destructive
"preview toggle" fast path (`events/message.ts:236-262`), so a tile attachment
must not be swept into a destructive full-replace by that branch.

**Storage and the read path — the reason to prefer this over the key.** The
materialised message tables are per-kind components behind `entities`
(`comp_embed_image`, `comp_embed_video`, `comp_embed_file`, `comp_embed_link` —
`db/schema-space.sql:199-242`), and the read path is that set UNIONed into a
flat media list (`queries/selectMessages.ts:333-374`), surfaced as
`Message.media: Media[]` (`queries/_message.ts:21-33`, `:126`) and rendered by
`MediaEmbed.svelte`. A `comp_embed_tile` row on that precedent gets the tile to
the client through `getMessages`, `getThreads`, the activity feed and search with
**no new endpoint, no admin-gated query, and no duplication of the projection**.

The DTO is the one place to be careful. `Media` is flat and renderer-agnostic
(one URL, an optional mime type, dimensions) and carries no `$type`, so the
client cannot currently tell a tile row from an image row. Two options:
give the tile its own DTO field (`Message.tiles`, which needs a new component
anyway), or generalise the media union. The narrower first option is the
recommendation — `linkEmbeds` is already a separate field for exactly this
reason, and a tile is not a medium.

**Payload size.** The tile payload rides inside the event, and there is no
application-level body-size cap on the path (`sendEvents`' input schema caps the
batch at 50 events, `schemas/procedures/sendEvents.ts:14-17`; the router reads the
JSON body with no limit, `xrpc/router.ts:236-238`). Small payloads — Mermaid
source, a game position, a poll's options — are comfortably fine. Large ones
(diagrams as image data, datasets) are not: the event log is the source of truth
and is replicated in full, so a megabyte per message is a megabyte in every
backup. The guidance worth writing down now: **the tile payload is small
structured data, and any large asset belongs in a blob the tile fetches from its
manifest** — which the tile can do without a host data channel at all. Worth an
explicit size bound in the schema's `.describe()` rather than a discovery at
scale.

**What this does not change.** The tile still receives its payload over
`tp-data` (§7.1): the attachment is the *transport* into Roomy's own data model,
and the mothership is what hands it to the sandboxed tile. Nothing here requires
`data.js` to be implemented differently, and nothing here changes milestone A.

### 11.1a Not chosen: the `at://`-keyed extension map

Recorded because it was the first candidate and because the verification is worth
keeping.

The alternative was an extension keyed directly by the tile's AT-URI, with
arbitrary JSON as the value:

```json
{ "extensions": { "at://did:plc:abc/ing.dasl.masl/3abc": { "mermaid": "graph TD; A-->B" } } }
```

**This passes `parseEvent` and is preserved verbatim** — ArkType's
`onUndeclaredKey: "ignore"` default over `MessageExtensionMap`'s derived keys
accepts and retains unknown keys:

```
"at:// key": { "at://did:plc:abc/ing.dasl.masl/3abc": { "mermaid": "graph TD; A-->B" } }
  => PASS, preserved: {"at://did:plc:abc/ing.dasl.masl/3abc":{"mermaid":"graph TD; A-->B"}}
```

It is genuinely zero-schema-change on the write side: `writeAuth.ts:856-863`
gates on the event `$type` alone, and `createMessage` is in `ALLOWED_TYPES`.

It was set aside for three reasons, all of them read-path:

1. **Nothing reads it.** The DTO carries no extensions field
   (`schemas/queries/_message.ts:92-130`) and the projection reads none —
   `comp_content` holds mime type, bytes, last-edit and timestamp
   (`db/schema-space.sql:153-162`). The raw event is durable in `stream_events`
   (`db/eventsSchema.sql`), so nothing is lost, but rendering would need a new
   read path; `space.roomy.sync.getEvents` can supply the event
   (`StreamManager.ts:479-489`) but is **admin-only** today
   (`handlers/space.roomy.sync.getEvents.ts:4`, `requireAdmin` at `:32`).
2. **It loses per-kind semantics.** Every existing attachment type has a row, a
   UNION branch, a DTO entry and a renderer. An `at://`-keyed blob has none, so
   the read path would have to be built anyway — at which point the union variant
   is the same amount of work in a shape the codebase already recognises.
3. **It is undiscoverable.** `unionToMap` (`primitives.ts:111`) enumerates the
   extension map's legal keys; an `at://` key is one only by accident of
   ArkType's default, and `MessageExtensionUpdateMap`/`DeleteMap` give it no
   place in the edit or delete protocol.

The verification stands, and if a future need is genuinely "arbitrary keyed
metadata that must not be modelled", this is the escape hatch and it already
works. It is not the right shape for a *tile*, which is a modelled thing.

### 11.2 The resolution path (feature 1, then feature 2)

**Phase 1 — a Bluesky-post tile end to end.** AT-URI recognition → manifest
resolution (appserver-side, cached) → embed-projection extension → sandboxed
card. Lands the first funded feature, on top of milestones A and B. Expected
upstream friction: what the embed shape does and does not carry (§5.3), and the
record-vs-blob reference question (§3.2, `darobin/dasl.ing#43`).

**Phase 2 — room context metadata.** A room-context event and a JSON column,
plus the `updateRoom` extensions gap (§6.3) if the context has to be editable
after creation. Renders a tile in a navbar slot from room state.

**Phase 3 — the calendar context tile.** The first context type end to end:
calendar event → context metadata → tile → RSVP. The RSVP is where §9.3's
whitelisted-public-write question gets its first concrete instance, and it may
turn out to be the point at which the feature stops and an upstream conversation
starts.

**Stretch, only if feature 1 has landed:** additional context types; a richtext
tile block (§5.3c); a `store.js` implementation (§7.4); the content-type → tile
mapping becoming a space setting rather than a pinned AT-URI (§5.4).

**Deliverables at the end:** the working Bluesky-post tile, the first room
context tile, the spec-and-tooling write-up, and links to the upstream issues
and PRs that came out of it.

**Thirty days after:** the engagement write-up (§10).

### 11.3 Which loading server a checkpoint can use

Worth stating explicitly, because it changes what can be started now. A
`loadDomain` must be reachable over HTTPS on a wildcard origin — that is not
negotiable — but it does **not** have to be a deployed service on a Roomy-owned
domain. `load.webtil.es` is the loader's own default, so milestone A can be
exercised against the DASL project's server with `loadDomain` left unset, using a
tile already published on AT. That decouples "does the render pipeline work"
from "do we have wildcard DNS", and only the latter has an outside-the-repo
dependency.

Two consequences to accept deliberately: every tile load in a dev/test run then
touches a third-party server, and any tile rendered that way is served under
someone else's header policy rather than the one Roomy would ship. Neither
matters for a checkpoint; both matter before a release.

## 12. Upstream risks and opportunities

Carried forward into the write-up and the issue list:

1. **The sandbox header set is disputed** (`darobin/dasl.ing#98`) — six specific
   concerns, including a missing `COEP` and `allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox`.
   Roomy shipping these headers is a decision to consume the model as published.
2. **`tp-editable` / `store.js` is unwritten.** A Roomy tile-store
   implementation would be a real contribution, and the thread's "localStorage
   for the PDS" framing is a concrete proposal.
3. **AT references in MASL** (`darobin/dasl.ing#43`) — an AT-URI field alongside
   the CID, and blob-reference norms. Feature 1 depends on the first.
4. **Live media cannot be expressed.** Streaming video needs a new protocol; the
   spec's own packaging discussion acknowledges large-content awkwardness.
5. **Chat-channel and tile-to-tile invocation** remain unimplemented in the spec
   ("a future version of this specification will add…"). Roomy's poll/RSVP and
   room-sync work may produce the first real implementation of that pattern, and
   is worth raising with the DASL project rather than only building privately.

## 13. Open questions

1. **Content-type → tile mapping** (§5.4): publisher allowlist, pinned AT-URI,
   or a Roomy default set? A default set is what makes the feature feel like a
   product, but it presumes a curation process.
2. **Embed shape** (§5.3): the tile attachment is settled as the carrier for an
   attached tile, but *how a resolvable link becomes a card* is not — extend
   `LinkEmbedData` (the recommendation, for the first cut), add a separate
   `Message.tiles`, or auto-attach a tile attachment on send?
3. **Resolution site** (§5.5): appserver-side manifest metadata + client-side
   mothership is the recommendation; the alternative (all client-side) is less
   code and leaks the user's link-following to the PDS from the browser.
4. **Central vs per-instance tile-loading server** (§8.1), and which domain.
5. **Room-context storage** (§6.3): one JSON column, or a component table? The
   former mirrors `sidebar_config`; the latter is better if entries need
   ordering or partial querying.
6. **Whether the context is editable after room creation** — today
   `updateRoom` cannot carry extensions at all, so this is a schema change
   either way (§6.3).
7. **Room-read capabilities** (§7.2): none in the first cut, or a small
   read-only verb set? The thread's conclusion that the compute belongs mostly
   on the client argues for handing the tile data the client already has.
8. **The tile attachment's DTO field** (§11.1, milestone B): a separate
   `Message.tiles` alongside `linkEmbeds`, or a generalised media union that
   carries the attachment `$type`? The former is narrower and matches how
   `linkEmbeds` was separated; the latter subsumes four existing renderers and
   is the better long-run model.
9. **The first public-write capability** (§9.3): is the calendar RSVP the right
   forcing function, and what does the manual-review process actually look like
   on the Roomy side?
10. **What the 30-day instrumentation measures** (§10), and what it is forbidden
    from measuring.
11. **Whether tile use is behind a feature flag.** Every comparable feature here
    has shipped behind one (`voice-chat`, `semble-integration`, `links-view`,
    `user-blocks` — `packages/appserver/src/featureFlags.ts:20-60`, defaulting
    off and served by `space.roomy.getFlags`). Given the sandbox is untested in
    production, a flag is the consistent choice and should be assumed.
12. **Whether the tile payload needs a declared size bound** (§11.1). The event
    log is the source of truth and is replicated in full, so payload size is a
    permanent cost; the recommendation is a bound stated in the schema's
    `.describe()` plus a documented rule that large assets belong in a blob the
    tile fetches from its manifest.
